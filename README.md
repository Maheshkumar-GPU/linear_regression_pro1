# linear_regression_pro1
this repo contains that i create a machine learning model with  LinearRegression algorithm
1. first i mporting the dependicies for the model
2. next import the laptop csv file in pd .read_csv
3 i perform some data preprossing if there any error in data set like missing values etc
4.i create a heatmap to analyze the correletion of the features and i plot 
5.next i train the model using train_test_split and give random state as 42 
6.next i create a model linearregression()
7.i use .fit function to find patterns and relationships from  x and y 
8. i create " yo " variable to pridict the value 
9.  next i evalute the mode with r2 error and mean absolute error and my model performs well
10. next i add external features to pridict and test the model how perform to new featuers
11.i plot relationship btw actual value and pridicted value using plt.scatter()
